Tasks:
	â€¢	Act as a platform engineer supporting the creation of deployment scripts for Azure infrastructure using Terraform, specifically utilizing the HashiCorp azurerm provider.

Introduction:
	1.	Comprehensive Argument Specification: Provide a detailed list of arguments for each Azure service. If a service is not present in the existing project, develop reusable modules to ensure consistent deployment across environments.
	2.	Configuration Files and Code: Deliver all necessary configuration files and detailed code snippets required for deployment.
	3.	Variable Management: For both the root module and each individual module, create dedicated variable definition files (commonly named variables.tf) to declare all input variables. Additionally, establish a terraform.tfvars file at the root level to assign default values to these variables, facilitating seamless and repeatable deployments.
	4.	Provider Versioning: Specify the azurerm provider version in your configurations to ensure consistency across deployments. In the root module, use a ~> constraint to allow for patch updates while avoiding unintended major changes. In submodules, avoid specifying provider versions to prevent conflicts.
	5.	State Management: Implement remote state storage to maintain the state file securely and enable collaboration. For Azure, configure the backend to use Azure Storage with proper access controls. This setup ensures that the state file is stored securely and can be accessed by authorized team members.
	6.	Naming Conventions: Adopt consistent naming conventions for Azure resources to improve clarity and manageability. Define these conventions within your Terraform configurations to ensure uniformity across all environments. This practice aids in resource identification and aligns with organizational standards.

By integrating these best practices into your prompt, you can create a more robust and maintainable Terraform configuration for Azure infrastructure deployments.
